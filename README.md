# Discuss contemporary issues regarding database or data-related issues
Nowadays with the advancement in technology, cybersecurity and other data-related
issues such as data breach or user privacy issues have risen to the minds of many people.
As a matter of fact, even though there are tons of softwares and cybersecurity companies
claiming that our(users') data can be protected against potential experienced hackers or sophisticated decryption technology, I still believe that data security is an ongoing issue that we personally should always look out for.

## Article 1
In [Microsoft says hackers viewed its source code](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/31/tech/microsoft-source-code/index.html), the author talks about the issue in which Microsoft claimed
that suspected Russian hackers have hacked into their system, using an software called SolarWinds Origin as an window, and viewed the company's source code. After reading through 
this article, I'm surprised that even for tech giant like Microsoft would one day encounter data breach issue where hackers could gain access to their system and looked for information they wanted to.

Frankly speaking, although Microsoft said hackers did not make any changes to its source code and customer data was also not compromised, I somehow suspect that some data may have already been divulged, but for the sake of protecting the company's renowned reputation and other unknown aspects, Microsoft made the announcement that hackers have only viewed their source code and nothing else happened. In other words, if I'm a hacker and have the ability to hack into one of the most prominent tech companies' highly guarded system, why would I only choose to view something if I can take something else(e.g. valuable data) with me? Therefore, since Microsoft knows that its company runs on a global scale, it is dangerous to directly disclose information such as customer data have already been compromised by hackers to the general public, as people would get increasingly worried that even for tech giant like them is vulnerable for cyber attack.

## Article 2
In [Concern mounts over government cyber agency's struggle to respond to hack fallout](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/02/politics/hack-goverment-cyber-struggle-respond-fallout/index.html), authors expand the cybersecurity issues that happened lately to Microsoft into discussing the government cyber agency's role in how to protect US computer networks and other data-related problems. It's surprising to see how CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the US, is only a "two-year-old agency with about 2,000 employees." Even though I'm not familiar with how government cyber agency works in the US, I'm astonished by the fact that many people have questioned into the abilities of these agencies after US officials have struggled with this fallout. In many people's minds, government security agency should serve as a backbone in protecting a country's future and safety, but with agency like the CISA, who "does not have the appropriate level of funding or necessary resources to effectively handle an issue of this magnitude," I suspect that other individuals like me would also worry about how our country's data, in which it might contains extremely confidential or secret information, can be protected against unknown cyber attack.

To be honest, without typing data-related issues into the search bar, I personally had no idea that an massive hacking campaign like this could happen to a country where majority of nowadays' eminent tech giants are founded or rooted on. Even though the article does not tell us whether any data breach has happened during this incident, one thing we might want to kept in our minds is that we should not blindly believe that our data is always secure, as living in a world where the notion of big data is being promulgated everywhere, we do not know for sure whether our data is truly being protected by someone or some agencies or organizations, to the fullest, as there might always exist a backdoor to any program or system that would potentially allow the experienced to hack into. Therefore, we should always keep an eye on our data and not let our intellectual properties to fall into the hands of the bad guys.
