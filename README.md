# Discuss contemporary issues regarding database or data-related issues
Nowadays with the advancement in technology, cybersecurity and other data-related
issues such as data breach or user privacy issue have risen to the minds of many people.
As a matter of facts, even though there are tons of softwares and cybersecurity companies
making their claims that our(users') data can be protected against potential experienced 
hackers or sophisticated technology, I still believe that cybersecurity and data security  are some ongoing issues that we should always looked out for, in which these are not problems that we should take lightly.

## Article 1
In [Microsoft says hackers viewed its source code](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/31/tech/microsoft-source-code/index.html), the author talks about the issue which Microsoft claimed
that suspected Russian hackers have hacked into their system, using an software called SolarWinds Origin as an window, and viewed the company's source code. After reading through 
this article, I'm really surprised that even for tech giant like Microsoft would one day encounter security issues where hackers could gain access to their system through security breach, while looking for information they wanted.

Frankly speaking, although Microsoft said hackers did not make any changes to its source code and customer data was not compromised, I still suspect that some data may have been already divulged, but for the sake of protecting the company's renowned reputation and other unknown aspects, it made the announcement that hackers have only viewed the source code and nothing else happened. In other words, if I'm a hacker and have the ability to hack into one of the most prominent tech companies' highly guarded system, would I only choose to view something instead of taking something else(e.g. valuable data) with me, if I know beforehand that this might be the only chance that can ever happened to me? Therefore, since Microsoft knows that its company runs on a global scale, it is dangerous to directly disclose information such as  customer data have been compromised by hackers to the general public, as people would get increasingly worried that even for tech giant like them is vulnerable for cyber attack.

## Article 2
In [Concern mounts over government cyber agency's struggle to respond to hack fallout](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/02/politics/hack-goverment-cyber-struggle-respond-fallout/index.html), authors expand the cybersecurity issues that happened lately to Microsoft into discussing the government cyber agency's role in how to protect US computer networks and other data-related problems. It's surprising to see how CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the US, is only a "two-year-old agency with about 2,000 employees." Even though I'm not familiar with how government cyber agency works in the US, I'm astonished by the fact that many people have questioned into the abilities of these agencies after US officials have struggled with this fallout. In many people's minds, government security agency should serve as a backbone in protecting a country's future and safety, but with agency like the CISA, who "does not have the appropriate level of funding or necessary resources to effectively handle an issue of this magnitude," I suspect that other individuals like me would also worry about how our country's data, in which it might contains extremely confidential or secret information, can be protected against unknown cyber attacks.

To be honest, without typing data-related issues in the search bar, I personally had no idea that an massive hacking campaign like this could happen to a country where majority of nowadays' eminent tech giants are founded or rooted on. Even though the article does not tell us whether any data breach has happened during this incident, one thing we might want to kept in our minds is that we should not blindly believe that our data is always secure, as living in a world where the notion of big data is being promulgated everywhere, we do not know for sure whether our data is truly being protected by someone or some agencies or organizations to the fullest, as there might always exist a backdoor to any program or system that could potentially allow the experienced to hack into. Therefore, we should always keep an eye on our data and privacy and not let our intellectual properties to fall into the hands of the bad guys.
